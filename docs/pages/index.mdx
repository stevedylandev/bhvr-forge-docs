`bhvr-forge` is a comprehensive full-stack TypeScript and Solidity monorepo starter that builds on the existing [bhvr stack](https://bhvr.dev) by adding blockchain capabilities through Foundry integration. This guide will help you understand how bhvr-forge works and how to get started with its smart contract features.

## Project Structure

bhvr-forge extends the traditional bhvr stack with an additional `contracts` package:

```
.
├── client/               # React frontend
├── server/               # Hono backend
├── shared/               # Shared TypeScript definitions
│   └── src/types/        # Type definitions used by both client and server
├── contracts/            # Solidity smart contracts with Foundry
│   ├── src/              # Contract source files
│   ├── script/           # Deployment scripts
│   └── test/             # Contract test files
└── package.json          # Root package.json with workspaces
```

## Prerequisites

Before you can use bhvr-forge, you need to have:

1. [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed for JavaScript/TypeScript development
2. [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) installed for Solidity development

To verify your Foundry installation, run:

```bash
forge --version
```

## Setting Up a New Project

Create a new bhvr-forge project using Bun's create command:

```bash
bun create bhvr-forge@latest
```

This will set up the entire monorepo with all the necessary packages.

## Working with Smart Contracts

bhvr-forge comes with a simple Counter contract for demonstration purposes, located in the `contracts/src` directory.

### Local Development Workflow

::::steps

#### Start the local Anvil blockchain

In a separate terminal, run:
```bash [terminal]
anvil
```

This starts a local Ethereum testnet on your machine with pre-funded accounts.

#### Deploy your contracts

```bash
cd contracts
bun run deploy:local
```

This command:
- Compiles your Solidity contracts
- Generates TypeScript types for your contracts (enabling type safety when interacting with them)
- Deploys the contracts to your local Anvil network
- Updates address references in your codebase

#### Start the development server

```bash
cd ../
bun run dev
```

This starts the full-stack application, including:
- React frontend (client)
- Hono backend (server)
- Type compilation watcher (shared)

#### Interact with your contract

The starter template includes examples of how to interact with your contract from the React frontend. You can call the Counter contract's state and increment it through the UI.

## Understanding Contract Types

One of the powerful features of bhvr-forge is automatic type generation for your smart contracts. When you deploy your contracts, TypeScript types are generated, enabling:

- Type-safe contract interactions
- Autocomplete for contract functions and parameters
- Error detection at compile time instead of runtime

These types are made available throughout the monorepo, ensuring consistency between your frontend, backend, and contract code.

## Available Scripts in the Contracts Package

The `contracts` package comes with several useful scripts:

- `bun run build`: Compiles your contracts
- `bun run test`: Runs contract tests
- `bun run deploy:local`: Deploys to local Anvil network
- `bun run generate-types`: Generates TypeScript types from your contracts

## Customizing Your Contracts

To add new contracts:

1. Create a new Solidity file in `contracts/src/`

2. Update the deployment script in `contracts/script/` to include your new contract

3. Update the `contracts/wagmi.config.ts` file with the path to your new contract

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@wagmi/cli'
import { foundry } from '@wagmi/cli/plugins'

export default defineConfig({
  out: 'generated/contracts.ts',
  plugins: [
    foundry({
      project: '.',
      artifacts: 'out',
      include: [ // [!code hl]
        'Counter.sol/**', // [!code hl]
        // Add your contract names here // [!code hl]
      ],// [!code hl]
    }),
  ],
})
```

4. Run the deployment process again

5. Your new contract will be available with full type support throughout the app

## Connecting to Other Networks

While the default setup uses a local Anvil network, you can configure the contracts package to deploy to testnets or mainnets:

1. Create environment-specific deployment scripts in the `contracts/script/` directory
2. Configure network details in `foundry.toml`
3. Create corresponding npm scripts in the contracts package.json

## Next Step

bhvr-forge combines the type-safe full-stack development of the bhvr stack with the power of Solidity smart contracts, providing a comprehensive starting point for Web3 applications. The tight integration between TypeScript and Solidity ensures a seamless development experience with shared types across the entire application.
